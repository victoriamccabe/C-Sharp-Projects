# Income Comparison Calculator

## Overview:
This program asks two people for their hourly pay and hours worked per week, then calculates and compares their annual salaries. It shows if Person 1 makes more money than Person 2.

## How it works:
1. The program starts by printing "Anonymous Income Comparison Program".
2. It asks for Person 1's hourly rate and hours worked per week.
3. It calculates Person 1's annual salary (hourly rate * hours per week * 52 weeks).
4. It asks for Person 2's hourly rate and hours worked per week.
5. It calculates Person 2's annual salary the same way.
6. It prints both annual salaries to the console.
7. Finally, it checks if Person 1 earns more than Person 2 and prints "True" or "False".

## Example Run:
"Anonymous Income Comparison Program"
"Person 1"
"Hourly Rate?"
15
"Hours worked per week?"
40
"Person 2"
"Hourly Rate?"
20
"Hours worked per week?"
40
"Annual salary of Person 1:"
31200
"Annual salary of Person 2:"
41600
"Does Person 1 make more money than Person 2?"
False

## Notes:
- The program uses double for the input values so it can handle decimals (for example, if someone makes 15.50 an hour).
- Results are printed exactly as calculated without formatting. You could add formatting (like commas or currency symbols) if needed.
