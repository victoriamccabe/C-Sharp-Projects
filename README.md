&nbsp;  

2. Navigate to the challenge project folder you want to run.  

&nbsp;  Example:

&nbsp;  Small Challenges/MathChallenge

&nbsp; 

3. Build the project (optional if already compiled):

&nbsp;  dotnet build

&nbsp; 

4. Run the executable:

&nbsp;  - Navigate to:

&nbsp;    bin/Debug/net8.0/

&nbsp;  - Double-click the .exe file to open it in the console.  

&nbsp;    Or, from the terminal:

&nbsp;    dotnet run

## Notes

- All projects are built using .NET 8.0.  

- Each challenge is self-contained and can be run independently.  

- These challenges are for learning and practice purposes.
