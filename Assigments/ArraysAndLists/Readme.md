# ARRAY AND LIST SELECTION PROGRAMS

## Assignment
This project was created based on the following assignment instructions:

- Create one-dimensional arrays or lists (strings or integers).  
- Ask the user to select an index of the array or list.  
- Display the content at the selected index on the screen.  
- Add comments to each line or block of your code to explain what it does exactly, so that another developer could read and understand your code.

## Project Overview
This project is a **C# console application** created to practice working with **arrays, lists, user input, and indexing**.  

The program contains **three parts**:  

1. An **array of colors** (strings).  
2. An **array of numbers** (integers).  
3. A **list of drinks** (strings).  

For each part, the user selects an index, and the program displays the item at that index.

## Requirements
The applications must:

- Create arrays or lists with the following examples:  
  - Colors: `Red, Blue, Green, Yellow, Purple`  
  - Numbers: `10, 20, 30, 40, 50`  
  - Drinks: `Coffee, Tea, Juice, Soda, Water`  
- Ask the user to select an index between **0 and the last valid index**.  
- Use **Convert.ToInt32** to read the user's input and convert it to an integer.  
- Check if the selected index is **within range**.  
- Display the content at the selected index.  
- Show an **error message** if the index is out of range.  
- Include comments explaining each line or block of code.
