# DAILY REPORT SUBMISSION ASSIGNMENT

## Project Overview
This project is a "C# console application" created as part of the "Daily Report Submission Assignment."  
The program simulates a simple "student daily report form," where user input is collected, stored in the correct data types, and displayed with appropriate prompts.  

---

## Requirements
The application must:

1. Start by printing:
   - "The Tech Academy."
   - "Student Daily Report."

2. Prompt the user with the following questions:
   - What is your name?
   - What course are you on?
   - What page number?
   - Do you need help with anything? (Answer "true" or "false")
   - Were there any positive experiences you’d like to share? (Please give specifics)
   - Is there any other feedback you’d like to provide? (Please be specific)
   - How many hours did you study today?

3. After all questions are answered, display:
   - "Thank you for your answers. An Instructor will respond to this shortly. Have a great day!"

4. Use "proper data types" and "clearly labeled variables" for each response.

5. Add "comments" to each line or block of code to ensure another developer can easily read and understand the program.

## How It Works
1. The program starts by greeting the student.  
2. It sequentially asks the student for information.  
3. Input is stored in appropriate variables ("string", "int", "bool", etc.).  
4. Finally, the program thanks the student and closes.
