# Employee Equality Operator Overloading in C#

## Assignment Instructions
1. Create an "Employee" class with "Id", "FirstName" and "LastName" properties.  
2. In the "Employee" class, overload the "==" operator so it checks if two Employee objects are equal by comparing their "Id" property. Remember that comparison operators must be overloaded in pairs.  
3. In the "Program.cs" file, instantiate two objects of the "Employee" class and assign values to their properties. Then compare the two Employee objects using the newly overloaded operators and display the results.  

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to create an "Employee" class in C# with the following features:
- Properties: "Id", "FirstName", and "LastName"
- Overloaded "==" and "!=" operators to compare employees by their **Id**
