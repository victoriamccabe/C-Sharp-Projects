# Bootcamp Assignments

This folder contains assignments I completed during the bootcamp.  

Each project is organized into its own folder. Inside every project folder, you will find a dedicated **Readme.md** file that explains the details of that specific project, including:  
- The assignment description  
- Objectives and requirements  
- Implementation details  
- How to run the project
