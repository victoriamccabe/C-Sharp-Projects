# MATH OPERATIONS CONSOLE APP

## Assignment

This project was created based on the following assignment instructions:

1. Create a class.
2. In that class, create a method that will take in an integer, create a math operation for this integer (addition, subtraction, etc.), then return the answer as an integer.
3. In the Main() method of the console app, instantiate the class and call the one method, passing in an integer. Display the result to the screen.
4. Add a second method to the class with the same name that will take in a decimal, create a different math operation for it, then return the answer as an integer.
5. In the Main() method of the console app, instantiate the class and call the second method, passing in a decimal. Display the result to the screen.
6. Add a third method to the class, with the same name, that will take in a string, convert it to an integer if possible, do a different math operation to it, then return the answer as an integer.
7. In the Main() method of the console app, instantiate the class and call the third method, passing in a string that equates to an integer. Display the result to the screen.
8. Add comments to each line or block of your code to explain what it does exactly, so that another developer could read and understand your code.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates **method overloading** in C#. The "DoMath" method is overloaded three times to accept different parameter types: integer, decimal, and string. Each method performs a different math operation, and the results are displayed in the console.
